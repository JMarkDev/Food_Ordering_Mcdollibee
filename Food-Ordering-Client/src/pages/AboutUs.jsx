              McDollibee’s phenomenal growth owes much to its strict and

              Food (F) served to the public must meet the company’s excellence
              standards or it will not be served at all; the Service (S) must be
              fast and courteous; Cleanliness (C), from kitchen to utensils,
              must always be maintained. McDollibee is proud of its employees
              who carry out their jobs.
